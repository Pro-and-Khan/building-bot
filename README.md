# AutoCrop of Residential Buildings Using Google Street View
Exciting research is being conducted using Google's street view imagery. Researchers can have access to training data that allows CNN training for topics ranging from assessing neighborhood environments to estimating the age of a building. However, due to the uncontrolled nature of imagery available via Google's Street View API, data collection can be lengthy and tedious. In an effort to help researchers gather address specific dwelling images efficiently, we developed an innovative and novel way of automatically performing this task. It was accomplished by exploiting Google's publicly available platform with a combination of 3 separate network types and post-processing techniques. Our uniquely developed NMS technique helped achieve 99.4\%, valid, address specific, dwelling images.

Code with tutorial will be posted soon.
